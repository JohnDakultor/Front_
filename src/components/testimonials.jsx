              clean, spacious, and well-appointed. Staff are very professional,
              helpful, and available. Angielyn, receptionist, and King,
              breakfast, are super nice and made my stay very pleasant. Will
              stay again in the future."

              great. Nice location. Definitely would stay here again, it's much
              better than all others in the area that I've stayed in. Free
              breakfast and easy to access the pool. The room could have been a
              little cleaner, and I got a deal to have the 1br for the studio
              price, but they still gave me a studio."
